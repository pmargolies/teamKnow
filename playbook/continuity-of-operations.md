# Overview
**Target Audience:**  All Stakeholders associated with essential functions and the systems that support them. Stakeholders may vary depending on the actual COOP event, however access to and familiarity with the knowledge described in this playbook will enlighten all users.  

Knowledge is critical to keeping essential services operating in the event of an emergency and/or disaster. The origin of this knowledge stems from your agency’s COOP Plan which obtains it’s authority from the following directives:
- National Security Presidential Directive (NSPD–51)/Homeland Security Presidential Directive (HSPD–20) - Directive on National Continuity Policy, May 2007
- Federal Continuity Directive 1 (FCD1) - Federal Executive Branch National Continuity Program and Requirements, Jan 2017
- Federal Continuity Directive-2 (FCD2) - Federal Executive Branch Mission Essential Functions and Candidate Primary Mission Essential Functions Identification and Submission Process, June 2017

In working through your COOP planning it’s imperative that the following elements are documented thoroughly and the documents are secured and accessible by those who have a need to know:
- Delegations of Authority
- Orders of Succession
- Alternate Location (s) Facts
- Standard Operating Procedures, Quick Facts
- Communication & Information Systems
- Essential functions, associated systems and their disaster recovery plans

Federal Continuity Directive-2 (FCD2) requires Executive Branch personnel to work through the identification of essential functions by performing:
- Business Process Analysis (BPA)
- Business Impact Analysis (BIA) (System & Process)
- Risk analysis (agency-wide) to further understand the agency’s tolerance for unknown threats

The essential functions give rise to identification of systems that support the essential functions identified. The three documents mentioned are essential components to the Knowledge Arsenal to be built by your agency.

Specific types of events can present their own unique challenges regarding accessing knowledge needed to continue use of essential systems, as well as how knowledge is disseminated given the circumstances surrounding the emergency.

This playbook will address three emergency scenarios that may spark a COOP response: 1.) Infrastructure failure (i.e. networks that support major applications are unavailable from the main location) 2.) Lack of People (i.e. widespread illness of employees that support major systems); 3.) Access to the operational facility is prohibited (i.e. road closure, building is contaminated, mass transit failure).

**COOP Stakeholders**
Stakeholder identification and knowledge management are integrated, essential components as these persons must have access to information and documentation surrounding COOP activities. Hardcopy files and access to the central document repository is essential.

**Knowledge Arsenal**
A list of potential artifacts that will prove valuable to users in the event of an emergency can be viewed here. {insert link}. This Knowledge Arsenal, may include documents that may contain information that includes sensitive data such as internet protocol (ip) addresses, so care must be taken in storing this information in both hard copy files and in the knowledge repository.
